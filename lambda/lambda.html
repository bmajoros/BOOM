Lambda Reference</h1></center>

<center><i>Bill Majoros</i></center>

<p><br>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
This is a brief reference for the language <i>lambda</i>, which is an implementation
of the <i>lambda calculus</i>.&nbsp; The lambda calculus is an abstract
language consisting of only three constructs: lambda expressions (lambda
(x) &lt;expr>), function calls (&lt;f> &lt;x>), and atoms, which are variables
and literals.
<p>The lambda calculus is normally just used in programming textbooks to
teach abstract concepts of programming languages and interpreters.&nbsp;
However, lambda, which is the basis for LISP and Scheme, can be implemented
to act as a real programming language, which, given a suitable set of primitives,
can support arbitrary computation.
<p>The advantage of lambda is that it has such a simple and consistent
syntax that it is relatively easy to implement an intrepter for it.&nbsp;
Because it is Turing-complete, it can easily be used for Genetic Programming,
a form of Genetic Algorithms used for evolving algorithms.&nbsp; The present
implementation of the language is written in C++, and provides an API for
C++ programs to communicate with lambda, so that Genetic Programming can
now be done in an efficient language like C++, while still evolving LISP-like
expressions.

<h2>
Identifiers</h2>
An identifier can be any sequences of letters, digits, ?, -, and possibly
other characters (I don't remember at the moment).

<h2>
Literals</h2>
<b>1. Character Literals</b>
<p>#a is the character a.&nbsp; #\n is the newline.&nbsp; You can also
use #\r, #\t, #\\, #', and #".
<p><b>2. Numeric literals</b>
<p>An integer is something like 123 or -123.&nbsp; A real number is something
like 3.14.
<p><b>3. String literals</b>
<p>A string literal is something like "Hello, world."
<p><b>4. Symbols</b>
<p>A symbol literal is something like 'x.&nbsp; A symbol is not a variable;
it does not stand for something.&nbsp; It just stands for itself.&nbsp;
However, if you (define 'x 6), because of the semantics of the define function,
the variable x (not the symbol, 'x) will come to be bound to 6.&nbsp; But
the symbol 'x is still just the symbol 'x, and stands for nothing but itself.
<p>

<h2>
Lambda Expressions</h2>
A lambda expression is a function literal.&nbsp; Such a function literal
is a <i>first-class object</i>, because it can be stored in data structures
and executed later.&nbsp; A lambda expression can occur anywhere in a program
that any other literal can occur.
<p>A lambda expression is denoted by a set of square brackets containing
a parameter list, followed by a vertical bar (|), followed by the function
body, which may consist of one or more expressions.&nbsp; The last expression
is the value returned by the function.&nbsp; All the expressions are evaluated
left-to-right, so this feature can be use to execute statements sequentially.
<p>For example, this line:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; [x y z | (print x) (print y) (print z)]
<br>will print x, followed by y, followed by z.
<p>

<h2>
If-Then-Else</h2>
Lambda has no built-in if-then-else construct, but it is easy to get the
same functionality using lambda expressions.
<p>The pre-defined <i>if</i> function takes 3 arguments.&nbsp; It evaluates
the first, and if it evaluates to true, it executes the second parameter,
otherwise the third.&nbsp; For example:
<p>(if (&lt; x 10) [|(print "less than ten")] [|(print "not less than ten")]
<p>First, the (&lt; x 10) is evaluated.&nbsp; The <i>then</i> and
<i>else</i>
parts are not immediately executed, because they occur inside lambda constructs.&nbsp;
They will be wrapped in closures and passed as first-class objects into
the <i>if</i> function as its second and third parameters.&nbsp; The appropriate
clause (<i>then</i> or <i>else</i>) will be called by <i>if</i> (with no
arguments) depending on the value of the first argument.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
True and False</h2>
True and false are not built into the lambda language, so it uses 1 to
denote true and <i>nil</i> to denote false.&nbsp; However, two predefined
variables, <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>, are bound to these values, so
that they may be used in your programs.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
nil</h2>

<p><br>The value <i>nil</i> represents the absence of an object.&nbsp;
It is equivalent to NULL in C++ and nil in Smalltalk.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
Function Invocation</h2>
A function is invoked by listing the function followed by its arguments
within parentheses:
<p>(f x y z)
<p>This will call the function currently bound to f, passing in the values
currently bound to x, y, and z as it arguments.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
Equality</h2>
Two distinct objects may have the same value, but they are still two different
objects.&nbsp; Thus, if you compare 6 and 6 using the = function, as in
(= 6 6), the value will be true.&nbsp; However, if you execute (eq? 6 6),
the value will be false, because both instances of '6' will evaluate to
a new 6 object, and those objects have different addresses.&nbsp; Thus,
eq? compares addresses of objects, and evaluates to true only when both
of its arguments evaluate to the address of one object.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
Lists</h2>
One of the few built-in types in lambda is the <i>cons cell</i>, also called
a <i>dotted pair</i>.&nbsp; A cons cell is an ordered pair of object pointers.&nbsp;
It is denoted in print by (a . b), but this is not legal lambda syntax,
so you may not use this in a lambda program.&nbsp; To create a cons cell
containing objects <i>a </i>and <i>b</i>, use (cons a b).
<p>A list can easily be constructed by creating a series of cons cells,
where the first element of each pair points to an object to be stored in
the list, and the second element of the pair points to the next pair in
the list.&nbsp; The second element of the very last pair in the sequence
should be nil, to terminate the list.&nbsp; When a sequence of cons cells
are set up in this way, the result is referred to as a list, but when a
cons cell has something other than a another cons cell as its second element,
it is instead referred to as an <i>improper list</i>.&nbsp; An improper
list may have a sequence of cons cells but be terminated by something other
than nil.&nbsp; Only when the last cell is terminated by nil is it called
a true list.
<p>For example, this is a list:&nbsp;(cons 1 (cons 2 (const 3 nil))).&nbsp;
It contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3.&nbsp; However, this is an improper
list:&nbsp;(cons 1 2), and so is this: (cons 1 (cons 2 3)).
