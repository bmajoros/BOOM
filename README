To compile:

1. Set your environment variable GSLDIR to the pull path to the 
   Gnu Scientific Library; this directory should have subdirectories
   called bin, include, and lib.  Also set your LIBRARY_PATH and
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables to the full path to the lib
   subdirectory of GSL.  For example:
      setenv GSLDIR /home/wmajoros/gsl
      setenv LIBRARY_PATH /home/wmajoros/gsl/lib
      setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/wmajoros/gsl/lib

2. In the BOOM/GSL subdirectory, create a symbolic link to the
   parent directory, and call it BOOM:
       cd BOOM/GSL ; ln -s .. BOOM ; cd -

3. Type "make libBOOM.a"
